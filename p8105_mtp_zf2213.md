## Introduction

Accelerometers have been powerful tools to study personal activities
over a long period of days. Unlike traditional ways of analysis, which
focus mainly on the total activity over the day, analyzing activity over
the course of the day can provide us more detailed information about the
behaviours of the individuals, thus valuable healthcare information.
This project aims at using both ways to analyse the accelerometer
records of a congestive heart failure (CHF) patient, trying to wrangle
valuable behaviour information about the patient.

## Data and Methods

  - Patient information

The patient is a 63-year old male with BMI 25, who was diagnosed with
congestive heart failure at Columbia University Medical Center. Consent
from the patient is assumed since this information has already been
public to whole class.

  - Methods

The methods of this project are using simple r programming skills along
with tidyverse packages to take a look at the activity distribution of
days across whole period, within a day, and across days in a week.

## Results

### Loading and tidying data

Columns are values rather than variables, so the first step to tidying
is loading the data and gathering the columns into the minutes (epoch)
of the days. Then rename some variables, make the variables with
reasonable data type, arrange the columns and rows.

``` r
# loading data and make to tall table
activity <- read_csv("./data/p8105_mtp_data.csv") %>% 
    # gather into long table
    gather(key = "minute_in_day", value = "counts", activity.1:activity.1440) %>% 
    # get the "minute" of a day, 
    mutate(minute_in_day = str_replace(minute_in_day, "activity.", "")) %>% 
    # change to integer
    mutate(minute_in_day = as.integer(minute_in_day)) %>% 
    # make day in week variable factor and relevel the day variable
    rename(day_in_week = day) %>%
    mutate(day_in_week = forcats::fct_relevel(day_in_week, c("Sunday", "Monday",
                                                                                                                     "Tuesday", "Wednesday",
                                                                                                                     "Thursday", "Friday",
                                                                                                                     "Saturday"))) %>% 
    # assuming the start of the first week is Sunday
    mutate(day = (week - 1) * 7 + as.integer(day_in_week)) %>% 
    # arrange the variable
    select(day, week, day_in_week, minute_in_day, counts)
```

After tidying, each row records the day, week, day\_in\_week,
minute\_in\_day, counts of an activity of a minute, there are in total
473760 minutes of 329 days.

### The total activity in each day

``` r
activity_day_total <- activity %>% 
# aggregate across minutes to create total activity
    group_by(day, day_in_week, week) %>% 
    # get total activity in the days
  summarize(day_total = sum(counts))

# necessary package to put two ggplot elements together
library(patchwork)

# density plot of distribution of total activity across days
density_total <- activity_day_total %>% 
    # label the outliers
  group_by(outliers = day_total > 100000) %>% 
    # plot the density plot
    ggplot(aes(x = day_total)) +
      geom_density(fill = "white") +
      # draw a line to label the cutoff
      geom_vline(xintercept = 100000, linetype = 2) +
      # make coordinator flip
      coord_flip() +
      # label axis
      labs(
        x = "Day total (counts)",
        y = "Density"
      ) +
      # ticks labels (before flip)
      scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
      scale_y_continuous(breaks = c()) 

# day total counts over time
scatter_total <- activity_day_total %>%
    # group by outliers
    group_by(abnormal_day = day_total < 100000) %>%
    # plot scatterplot
    ggplot(aes(x = day, y = day_total, color = abnormal_day)) +
      # scatterplot
      geom_point(size = 2) +
      # draw a line for cutoff
      geom_hline(yintercept = 100000, linetype = 2) +
      # get regression line for the days (exclude outliers)
      geom_smooth(method = "lm", aes(linetype = abnormal_day), color = "black", show.legend = FALSE, se = FALSE) +
      # labels, ticks, axis, titles, etc...
      scale_linetype_manual(values = c(1, 0)) +
      labs(x = "Day", color = "Abnormal Days", fill = "Abnormal Day") +
      theme(
       axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
       axis.title.y = element_blank(),
       axis.text.y = element_blank()
      )

# put two plots together
density_total + scatter_total + plot_layout(widths = c(0.2, 1.8))
```

It turns out that in some days the total activity are extremely low,
they are actually missing days (refer to supplementary material) of this
time series observations. For statistical analysis, it would be better
removing NAs.

Null hypothesis: slope is 0. Alternative hypothesis: slope is not equal
to 0. Significance level: 0.01.

``` r
# get linear regression analysis
(stats_day_total <- summary(lm(day ~ day_total,
         data = activity_day_total %>% filter(day_total > 100000))))
```

    ## 
    ## Call:
    ## lm(formula = day ~ day_total, data = activity_day_total %>% filter(day_total > 
    ##     1e+05))
    ## 
    ## Residuals:
    ##      Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max 
    ## -181.373  -80.065    1.849   75.221  180.467 
    ## 
    ## Coefficients:
    ##              Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
    ## (Intercept) 1.081e+02  1.998e+01   5.407 1.33e-07 ***
    ## day_total   1.740e-04  5.008e-05   3.475 0.000588 ***
    ## ---
    ## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
    ## 
    ## Residual standard error: 90.92 on 293 degrees of freedom
    ## Multiple R-squared:  0.03959,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.03631 
    ## F-statistic: 12.08 on 1 and 293 DF,  p-value: 0.0005877

The p-value of correlation of total activities over time is 5.8810^{-4}.
So at 0.01 significance level, we have enough evidence to reject the
null hypothesis and conclude that the patient became more active over
time.

``` r
# across week, show the distribution of activities for each day in a week
activity_day_total %>%
  # remove outliers
    filter(day_total > 100000) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(y = day_total, x = day, group = day_in_week)) +
      geom_boxplot() +
      geom_point(aes(color = day_in_week)) +
      geom_smooth(method = lm) +
      facet_grid(. ~ day_in_week)
```

### Activities over a day

``` r
# display 24-hour profile for each day using 2d density plot
activity %>%
    ggplot(aes(y = minute_in_day / 60, x = day, color = log10(counts))) +
      geom_point(size = 0.1, alpha = 0.5) +
      scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1, 49, 55, 92, 108, 185, 243, 259, 300, 329)) +
        scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0, 8, 16, 24)) +
      viridis::scale_color_viridis(
        name = "Activity Intensity",
        discrete = FALSE
      ) +
      labs(
        y = "Time (hour)",
        x = "Day (with special days labelled)"
      ) +
      theme(
        axis.text.x = element_text(color = "red", angle = 45)
      )
```

``` r
# refer to supplementary material for special days
```

### Daily distribution

``` r
activity %>%
    # grouping to get number of a type of activity
    group_by(minute_in_day, day_in_week) %>%
    summarize(total_activity = sum(counts)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = minute_in_day / 60, y = total_activity, color = day_in_week)) +
      geom_point(size = 1, alpha = 0.6) +
      geom_smooth(color = "black", linetype = 1) +
      scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 8, 16, 24)) +
      scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
      labs(
        x = "Time (hour)",
        y = "Total Counts",
        color = "Day in Week"
      ) + 
      facet_grid(. ~ day_in_week)
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'

## Supplementary material

``` r
